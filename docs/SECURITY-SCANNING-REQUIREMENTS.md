- [ ] Backup security and encryption
- [ ] Logging and monitoring security
- [ ] MySQL error log security

### 6. **Laravel-Specific Security**
- [ ] Laravel security best practices compliance
- [ ] Middleware security implementation
- [ ] Route protection and access controls
- [ ] File upload security (artwork uploads)
- [ ] API endpoint security
- [ ] Database migration security
- [ ] Eloquent ORM query security

### 7. **phpMyAdmin-Specific Security**
- [ ] phpMyAdmin installation security
- [ ] Access control and user management
- [ ] Session timeout and security settings
- [ ] File upload restrictions
- [ ] SQL query execution security
- [ ] phpMyAdmin configuration file security
- [ ] Integration with Laravel authentication

## Tools to Use
- **Static Analysis**: PHPStan, Psalm, Larastan
- **Security Scanning**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite
- **Database Security**: MySQL Security Check, phpMyAdmin Security Scanner
- **Dependency Scanning**: Composer audit, npm audit
- **Code Quality**: PHP_CodeSniffer, PHP Mess Detector
- **MySQL Security**: MySQL Security Configuration Checker

## Database Security Checklist

### MySQL Server Security
- [ ] MySQL running on localhost only (127.0.0.1)
- [ ] Root user access properly restricted
- [ ] Database user has minimal required privileges
- [ ] MySQL error logging configured securely
- [ ] MySQL configuration file permissions restricted
- [ ] MySQL service running with appropriate user permissions

### phpMyAdmin Security
- [ ] phpMyAdmin accessible only via Laravel routes
- [ ] Strong authentication required
- [ ] Session timeout configured appropriately
- [ ] File upload restrictions in place
- [ ] SQL query execution logging enabled
- [ ] phpMyAdmin configuration files secured

### Connection Security
- [ ] Database connections use prepared statements
- [ ] Connection strings don't expose credentials
- [ ] Environment variables properly secured
- [ ] Database connection encryption enabled
- [ ] Connection pooling configured securely

## Deliverables
- [ ] Security vulnerability report
- [ ] Database security assessment report
- [ ] phpMyAdmin security evaluation
- [ ] Risk assessment matrix
- [ ] Remediation recommendations
- [ ] Security testing results
- [ ] Compliance checklist
- [ ] Database security hardening guide

## Priority
**Critical** - Must be completed before production deployment, with special emphasis on database security

## Acceptance Criteria
