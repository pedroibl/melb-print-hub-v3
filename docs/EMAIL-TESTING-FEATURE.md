- Configuration validation endpoints

#### Key Endpoints:
- `GET /email-testing` - Main testing dashboard
- `POST /email-testing/test` - Process test submissions
- `GET /email-testing/mobile-test` - Mobile test page
- `POST /email-testing/mobile-test-submit` - Mobile test submissions

### 3. React Dashboard (`EmailTesting.jsx`)

A comprehensive React component that provides:
- Real-time email configuration status
- Interactive test form
- Detailed test results display

- Real-time feedback
- Network error handling

## Testing Workflow

### Desktop Testing:
1. Navigate to `/email-testing`
2. Review email configuration status
3. Fill out the test form
4. Submit and review results
5. Check email inbox for test message

### Mobile Testing:
1. Start server with: `php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000`
2. Access `/email-testing/mobile-test` on mobile device
3. Fill out the mobile-optimized form
4. Submit and review results
5. Check email inbox for test message

## Email Configuration Requirements
